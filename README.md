# colombia-env-data-pipeline
A production-grade, end-to-end data engineering project that ingests, stores, transforms, and visualises **weather** and **air-quality** data for the eight largest cities in Colombia.

Built as the capstone project for the [DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp).

## Problem statement
Colombia is a country of dramatic environmental diversity: Bogotá sits at 2,640 m and rarely breaks 20 °C, Barranquilla sits at sea level and rarely drops below 25 °C, and Medellín — the "city of eternal spring" — is wedged between mountains that trap pollution in predictable patterns. Air quality and climate are closely tied to **elevation**, **time of year**, and **population density**, but that relationship is hard to see without aligning multiple datasets on a consistent schema.

This pipeline does that:
1. Pulls **historical hourly weather** (back to 2020) from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com).
2. Pulls **daily ground-station air quality** (PM2.5, PM10, O₃, NO₂, SO₂, CO) from [OpenAQ v3](https://docs.openaq.org).
3. Simulates a **real-time IoT sensor stream** through Kafka.
4. Lands everything as partitioned parquet in GCS, exposes it via BigQuery external tables, and shapes it with dbt into dashboard-ready facts.
5. Runs a monthly Spark job for heavy historical aggregations (climate normals, 30-day rolling windows, heat-wave detection).
6. Surfaces the result in a Looker Studio dashboard.


### Questions the dashboard answers
- How does each city's air quality rank against WHO guidelines?
- Where and when do heat waves hit hardest, and are they getting longer?
- Which cities have the worst combined **environmental stress** (heat + humidity + pollution)?
- How does pollution correlate with rainfall across climate zones?


### The 8 cities
Chosen to span Colombia's five climate zones (*tierra caliente* to *paramo*) and capture ~50% of the country's population.

| City          | Department       | Elevation | Population | Climate zone          |
|---------------|------------------|-----------|------------|-----------------------|
| Bogotá        | Cundinamarca     | 2,640 m   | 7.7 M      | Tierra muy fría       |
| Medellín      | Antioquia        | 1,495 m   | 2.6 M      | Tierra templada       |
| Cali          | Valle del Cauca  | 1,000 m   | 2.2 M      | Tierra templada       |
| Barranquilla  | Atlántico        | 18 m      | 1.3 M      | Tierra caliente       |
| Cartagena     | Bolívar          | 2 m       | 1.1 M      | Tierra caliente       |
| Bucaramanga   | Santander        | 959 m     | 0.6 M      | Tierra templada       |
| Pereira       | Risaralda        | 1,411 m   | 0.5 M      | Tierra templada       |
| Santa Marta   | Magdalena        | 6 m       | 0.5 M      | Tierra caliente       |

## Quick start

### Prerequisites
- A Google Cloud project with **billing enabled** and the following APIs on: Cloud Storage, BigQuery.
- Local tooling: **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, **Terraform ≥ 1.5**, **GNU Make**, **gcloud CLI**.
- A **service-account JSON key** with this permissions for GCS, BigQuery, and Dataproc.
- A free **OpenAQ API key** from [explore.openaq.org/register](https://explore.openaq.org/register).


### 1. Clone and configure
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/colombia-environmental-pipeline.git
cd colombia-environmental-pipeline
```

```bash
# .env
GCP_PROJECT=<project-id>
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/absolute/path/to/key.json
GCS_BUCKET=<bucket-id>
BQ_REGION=<region>
RAW_DATASET=<raw_ds_name>
WAREHOUSE_DATASET=<wh_ds_name>
DATAPROC_REGION=<region>
DATAPROC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=<account-name>@<project-id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
OPENAQ_API_KEY=<api_key>
KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP=kafka-core:29092
KAFKA_TOPIC=weather.sensor.readings
EMIT_INTERVAL_SEC=2
BATCH_SIZE=100
BATCH_TIMEOUT_SEC=30
```

```bash
# terraform/terraform.tfvars
project_id     = "<project-id>"
region         = "<region>"
bucket_name    = "<bucket-id>"
dataset_prefix = "<prefix>"
create_service_account = <true/false>
```


### 2. Provision the cloud infrastructure
```bash
make tf-init
make tf-plan
make tf-apply
```
The output tells you the bucket name and dataset IDs — make sure they match
what's in your `.env`.


### 3. Build the container image for ingestion
```bash
make build-ingestion
```


### 4. Enable real-time data streaming
```bash
make kafka-up
```
This captures the data through the API as soon as it is updated in the web page


### 5. (Recommended) Run the process with an orchestration with kestra
```bash
make kestra-up
```
1. Add the `gcp_credentials.json` file to the namesapce files under the name `gcp_key.json` (this is neccessary for the python tasks).
2. Import the workflows in `kestra/flows/`.
3. Add KV pairs in the Store (GCP_PROJECT, GCS_BUCKET, BQ_REGION, RAW_DATASET, WAREHOUSE_DATASET, DATAPROC_REGION, DATAPROC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT, OPENAQ_API_KEY).
4. Run all the worflows in order.


### 6. (Optional) Run the process locally fot testing
```bash
# Extract raw data
make ingest-historical
make ingest-daily
make ingest-air-quality

# Transform with dbt
make dbt-build
```


### 7. Run the monthly aggregations with spark
```bash
make deploy-spark-job
make submit-spark-batch
```

## How each zoomcamp module is covered

### Module 1 — Infrastructure as Code
- **Docker**: every runtime (ingestion, producer, consumer) ships as a container with pinned dependencies. Kestra itself runs in a container with a Postgres metastore.
- **Terraform**: `terraform/main.tf` provisions a versioned, autoclass-enabled GCS bucket plus two BigQuery datasets. An optional service account with least-privilege IAM is gated behind a boolean variable.

### Module 2 — Workflow orchestration
- **Kestra** in standalone mode with a Postgres backend.
- Five flows with **schedules**, **subflow chaining** (daily ingestion → dbt), **retry policies**, and **error handlers**.
- The historical backfill flow accepts **inputs** for the date range, making it reusable for any time window.

### Module 3 — Data warehouse
- **BigQuery**, region-configurable.
- Raw data lives as **external tables** over hive-partitioned parquet in GCS — zero storage cost for the raw layer.
- Mart fact tables are **partitioned by month on `observation_date`** and **clustered by `city_id`** (and `parameter_name` where relevant). This brings typical dashboard query scans below 100 MB even across 5 years.

### Module 4 — Analytics engineering
- **dbt** with BigQuery adapter, three model layers (`staging` / `intermediate` / `marts`).
- `dbt_utils` package for surrogate keys and accepted-range tests.
- Tests: `unique`, `not_null`, `relationships`, `accepted_values`, and custom range checks on temperature and humidity.
- **Documentation** generated with `dbt docs` — served locally via `make dbt-docs`.
- A `dim_cities` dimension derived from a **seed** (`seeds/cities.csv`).

### Module 5 — Batch processing
- **PySpark 3.5** job containing four things dbt doesn't do as gracefully:
  1. Monthly climate normals against a long-run per-city baseline.
  2. 30-day rolling aggregates with **range-based windows** (not row-based — this matters when days are missing).
  3. Year-over-year anomalies.
  4. **Heat-wave detection** via a gap-and-islands pattern on consecutive high-temperature days.
- Output parquet is partitioned back by city and picked up by a BigQuery external table — no ETL round-trip.

### Module 6 — Streaming
- Producer fetches current weather every `EMIT_INTERVAL_SEC` and publishes keyed by `city_id` for ordering guarantees.
- Consumer uses **manual offset commits** — offsets are only committed after a successful GCS write, so crashes can't lose messages.
- Batch-by-size-or-time flushing strategy keeps file counts sane while bounding end-to-end latency.

## Operational notes

### Cost
With the default region (`us-central1`) and the 8-city volume, running costs
stay inside GCP's always-free tier or cents-per-month.

### Idempotency
- Every ingestion path writes to a **date-scoped parquet key**, so accidental re-runs overwrite in place rather than duplicating rows.
- dbt's intermediate `int_weather_deduped` deduplicates on `(city_id, observation_ts)` with latest-`ingested_at` wins, covering the seam between the historical backfill and the daily incremental.

### Monitoring
- Kestra surfaces every flow execution in its UI with full logs and timing.
- dbt tests catch schema drift, null explosions, or impossible values (negative humidity, -200 °C temperatures).

## What I'd add next
Honest roadmap rather than a "future work" checkbox:
- **dbt snapshots** on `dim_cities` — the seed is static today but demographic changes over time would be good to track.
- **Great Expectations** or **dbt-expectations** on the raw layer for pre-dbt quality gates.
- **A dead-letter queue** in the Kafka consumer for malformed messages.
- **CI/CD**: a GitHub Actions workflow under `.github/workflows/` that runs `dbt build` against a dev dataset on every PR.
- **A proper unit-test suite** for the Spark aggregation logic. Right now the heat-wave detection is covered by visual inspection only.
